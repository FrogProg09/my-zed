    <h4> A simple Zed configuration for linux.</h4>

I've recently decided to try out zed, and this is my attempt to mess around with its dotfiles for better look and feel.
Mostly I've created it for myself, there is a few keybinds that I've changed, but feel free to do with it anyting you want, this repo is under BSD-3 licence.

## Installation

There is a script that will backup your configs of zed if any from ~/.config/zed to ~/.config/zed-oldconfig directory.
It will also install my config into ~/.config/zed direcotry

To install my config, you need only 3 commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrogProg09/my-zed.git
cd my-zed
bash install.sh
```

Voila! You now have your fresh new config installed on your system
